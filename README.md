# Investigate_a_Dataset

## Project introduction

To investigate a dataset project I will analyze data about “TMDB movie”. I will be mainly focusing on the relationship between components. To do this analysis, I will be looking closely at their relationship between revenues, popularity, genres, and released year.

Here are the lists of my questions for this data set project:

1. What are the most frequent genres?
2. Is higher popularity make higher in revenues?
3. How many genres were released each year?
